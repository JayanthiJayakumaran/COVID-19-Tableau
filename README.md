# COVID-19-Tableau

The COVID-19 dashboard that is shown above is created using Tableau Public. First, I created several worksheets like Map, Summary, Cases, Deaths, and Recovery. Then I created a dashboard, as shown above, applied filters, and created calculated fields for customization. This Dashboard provides details about the number of deaths, the number of recovered, and the number of cases reported in COVID-19.
